# Expense_Tracker

Expense Tracker Application
Overview: Create a application that allows users to record, view, and categorize expenses. The application should allow users to filter expenses by date or category and calculate total expenses.
Core Requirements:
Data storage for expenses with fields like data, amount, category, and description.
Ability to filter and search expenses by criteria (date range, category).
Summary function that shows total expenses by category and overall.
Language-specific feature examples:
Python: Use dictionaries for data storage, demonstrate Pythonâ€™s dynamic typing, and use libraries like datetime for date manipulation.
C++: Emphasize memory management, use structs or classes for expenses, and demonstrate use of STL containers.
